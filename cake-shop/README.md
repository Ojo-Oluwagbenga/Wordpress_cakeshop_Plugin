# Cake Shop Wordpress Widget

This is a plugin that scraps data from the CodeIgniter Application

This will be running on a different server from the CDI app. Kindly ensure the wordpress server SQL is not running on port 3306 as CDI DB runs on the port. Otherwise, you may run CDI Application on on different port.

PLEASE NOTE:
   The code requires the CDI to run on http://localhost:8080
   And the wordpress server on http://localhost/wordpress

### Version
